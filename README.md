# The Flu: Friend-Name Bingo Game Concept

## Overview

The Flu is a competitive social game for small friend groups where players aim to fill a bingo board of friends' names by meeting them in real life. One player is secretly designated as the **Cooties**, whose playful mischief slows their progress and can be transferred to others.

## Players

* 4-6 friends recommended
* Each player has a bingo board (3x3 or larger)
* Each tile represents a friend in the group

## Objectives

* **Win condition:** Complete any row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) first to achieve bingo. Only the first player to complete a row wins.
* **Cooties twist:** The Cooties progress slower until they spread the curse to another player. After a few days, the Cooties role will randomly transfer to a new player even if it hasn't been actively spread.

## Rules

### Daily Actions

* Each player can perform **one action per day**:

  1. **Claim a player:** meet them in real life to gain their tile.
  2. **Guess who has Cooties:** try to deduce the cursed player.

### Action Outcomes

* **Claim Action:**

  * Gain 1 tile normally.
  * If claiming a player with Cooties, the Cooties is transferred to the claimed player, and the original Cooties is cured.
* **Guess Action:**

  * **Correct guess:** gain 2 tiles of the guessed player.
  * **Incorrect guess:** lose 1 random claimed tile.

### Cooties Mechanics

* 1 player is secretly the **Cooties**.
* Each day, the Cooties **lose a random claimed tile** until they spread it to another player.
* Spreading Cooties occurs via claiming another player.
* The role remains hidden until the cursed player interacts with someone.
* **Automatic transfer:** after a few days, the Cooties role randomly moves to a new player, keeping the game dynamic.

## Game Flow

1. Check the app for your board.
2. Each day, choose **one action** (claim or guess).
3. Apply Cooties mechanics and action outcomes.
4. Repeat until a player completes a row and wins.

## Optional Mechanics

* Mini-games for claiming tiles.
* Randomized boards to keep interactions fresh.
* Larger boards for longer gameplay.
* Subtle clues to help players deduce who has Cooties.

## Key Points

* Competitive with playful tension from the Cooties mechanics.
* Simple daily play: 1 interaction or guess per player.
* The Cooties naturally progress slower, adding humor and strategy.
* Guessing introduces risk/reward and deduction.
* The Cooties role can automatically transfer to keep gameplay dynamic.
* Encourages real-life social interaction.
* Easy to implement as a mobile or web app.
